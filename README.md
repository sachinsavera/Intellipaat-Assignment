Title: Designing a Fitness Tracking App for Elderly Users

Objective:

The objective of this project is to design an intuitive, easy-to-use, and accessible fitness-tracking mobile application specifically tailored for the elderly population,
to promote physical activity and healthy living. 

Tailoring to the Elderly Demographic: 

Elderly users often have unique needs and limitations when it comes to using digital technology. They may have visual or cognitive impairments, or they may
simply be less familiar with digital interfaces. The app's design should take these factors into account to create an interface that is simple, intuitive, and accessible.

Promoting Physical Activity:

The primary purpose of a fitness tracking app is to encourage users to stay active. The app should provide features that inspire motivation, such as goal
setting, progress tracking, reminders or alerts, and possibly social features for sharing progress or challenges.

Incorporating Health Guidance:

Elderly users may have specific health considerations or restrictions. The app could offer features to cater to this, such as low-impact exercise suggestions,
heart rate monitoring, integration with health data, or reminders for medication.

Creating an Intuitive User Experience:

The app should be easy to navigate and use. This includes having a clear layout, logical flow, and features that are easy to understand and use. The design should
also be aesthetically pleasing, with appropriate use of colors, fonts, and images.

Ensuring Accessibility:
The design should adhere to accessibility guidelines to cater to users with potential visual, auditory, motor, or cognitive impairments. This could involve
features like text-to-speech, large touch targets, high contrast for visual elements, and more.

The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly app that encourages elderly users to track and improve their physical activity, contributing to a healthier
lifestyle. Remember to emphasize accessibility, simplicity, and ease of use in your design.

Goals:

● Enable visitors to explore different exhibitions, each featuring a collection of artwork.
● Enable visitors to learn more about individual pieces of art, including details about the artwork and the artist.
● Design an engaging interactive experience for the users.
● Incorporate social features, such as sharing a specific artwork, liking an artwork, or commenting on it.
● Ensure the platform is accessible and user-friendly to a broad audience.
